# Numbers 1 Query

Reading the book of Numbers with Data Analysis eyes, I've realized that there is an interesting "query" that could be written in code. Imagining we had a dataset for the whole population but just wanted to count the ones apt for war, these are codes in R, Stata and Python.

- Thoughts on imputation

"Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness (...) And he received a seal (...) of the righteousness of the faith which he had while still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all those who believe, though they are uncircumsised, that  * righteousness might be imputed to them also*. " Romans 4:3,11 (acc Genesis 15:6)

Can you grasp the depth of this statement ? 

If you had two datasets, like an accounting statement for each person: one representing all your good deeds in one column, and bad deeds with its penaltu(debt) in another.

And then Jesus's dataset , representing all his rigteousness (he only did good, fulfilled the law perfectly). 

On the cross, Jesus took all your debt (and the debt of all humankind). 

And, to those who believe on Him, he offers a "data imputation".... to have his righteousness imputed on our balance, on our records ! How wonderful is that ? 

This data imputation is available to all who chose to come to Jesus, just like they are. You don't need to accumulate any good deeds to show him. He already knows all your bad deeds and the debt you own : He himself carried the weight of it at the cross. He already finished His part. Now, the gift is yours. It is available to you, free of cost. Will you accept it ? 

All you need is to ackowledge the truth of your own dataset, and how it is missing the "right data" to be counted worthy to be in the Presence of Almighty God. The God who created you, who has a claim to your life. The God who gave you life and loves you beyond measure. The God who wants you to be His child, who cares for you deeply, more than anyone ever could. The God who was willing to go to any extend to have a relationship with you. 

When you come with an honest heart, and ask for the "data imputation" to be made, the transfer is done ! Once and for all. Now, your record is clean. "Having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand". (Romans 5:1)
